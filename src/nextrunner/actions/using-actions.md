# Using Actions

## `runBlocking`

The simplest way to execute an action is with `runBlocking()`. 
This function will run the given action to completion while blocking the current thread.
This is useful for simple, sequential autonomous op modes.

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin
runBlocking(MyAction())
```

== Java

```java
Actions.runBlocking(new MyAction());
```

:::

While the action is running, telemetry packets are sent to FTC Dashboard, 
allowing you to visualize the action's state.

## `ActionRunner`

For more complex scenarios, like tele-op, 
where you need to run multiple actions concurrently, 
you can use the `ActionRunner`.
It is a singleton object that manages a queue of asynchronous actions.

### Running Actions

To run an action with the `ActionRunner`, simply call `ActionRunner.run()`:

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin
ActionRunner.run(MyAction())
```

== Java

```java
ActionRunner.run(new MyAction());
```

:::

You can also run multiple actions at once:

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin
ActionRunner.run(
    MyAction1(),
    MyAction2()
)
```

== Java

```java
ActionRunner.run(
    new MyAction1(),
    new MyAction2()
);
```

:::

### Updating the Queue

The `ActionRunner` needs to be updated on every loop of your op mode. 
This is done by calling `ActionRunner.update()` at the end of your `loop()` method.

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin
override fun loop() {
    // ... your other loop code

    ActionRunner.update()
}
```

== Java

```java
@Override
public void loop() {
    // ... your other loop code

    ActionRunner.update();
}
```

:::

The `update()` method will execute the actions in the queue and send telemetry to FTC Dashboard.

### Action Interruption

When a new action is added to the queue, 
the `ActionRunner` will check if any of the currently running actions 
share any requirements with the new action.
If they do, and the running action is `Interruptible`, its `onInterrupt()` method will be called,
and it will be removed from the queue.
This allows you to create complex, priority-based behaviors.

### Op Mode Lifecycle

The `ActionRunner` automatically manages the action queue across different op mode stages. 
It ensures that the queue is empty before `opModePreInit` and clears it after `opModePostStop`.
