# Creating Actions

Actions are the basic building blocks of `NextRunner`'s non-blocking control flow. They are composable, stateful commands that can be executed sequentially or in parallel.

There are a few ways to create actions:

## Action Interface

The most basic way is to implement the `Action` interface. 
This is a functional interface with a single abstract method, `run(p: TelemetryPacket)`, 
which is called on every loop. 
It should return `true` if the action is still running, 
and `false` if it has completed. 
The `p` argument can be used to communicate information back to FTC Dashboard.

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin
class MyAction : Action {
    override fun run(p: TelemetryPacket): Boolean {
        // ... do something
        return true // or false
    }
}
```

== Java

```java
class MyAction implements Action {
    @Override
    public boolean run(@NonNull TelemetryPacket p) {
        // ... do something
        return true; // or false
    }
}
```

Note that while it is possible to create an `Action` 
by making an implementation of the interface, 
it can be tedious to do this for every possible robot action.
Since `Action` is a functional interface, 
it is easy to create objects of it without direct subclassing.
This means you can create methods of your robot classes that simply return 
anonymous objects of it.

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin 
class Subsystem {
    fun myAction(): Action {
        return Action { 
            //the TelemetryPacket paramemter is named `it` by default in the lambda
            // ... do something
            true // or false
        }
    }
}
```

== Java

```java
class Subsystem {
    public Action myAction() {
        return p -> { 
            // here we named the TelemetryPacket parameter `p` 
            // ... do something
            return true; // or false
        };
    }
}
```

### Previewing Actions

The `Action` interface also provides a `preview()` method that can be overridden to draw a preview of the action on the FTC Dashboard field overlay. This is useful for visualizing the robot's path or other actions during autonomous.

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin
class MyAction : Action {
    override fun run(p: TelemetryPacket): Boolean {
        // ... do something
        return true // or false
    }

    override fun preview(fieldOverlay: Canvas) {
        // ... draw on the field overlay
    }
}
```

== Java

```java
class MyAction implements Action {
    @Override
    public boolean run(@NonNull TelemetryPacket p) {
        // ... do something
        return true; // or false
    }

    @Override
    public void preview(@NonNull Canvas fieldOverlay) {
        // ... draw on the field overlay
    }
}
```

### Action Requirements

Actions can also declare requirements. Requirements are a set of objects that the action needs to function. The `ActionRunner` will ensure that no two actions with the same requirement can run at the same time. This is useful for preventing two different actions from trying to control the same motor or servo simultaneously.

The type of `requirements` is `Set<Any>` to allow any object to be a requirement.
This can be a subsystem, a motor object, etc.

You can specify requirements by overriding the `requirements` property in your action, 
or by calling the `withRequirements` function, which returns a copy of the receiver with its argument (either multiple objects or a set of objects) as the requirements.

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin
class MyAction(private val subsystem: Subsystem) : Action {
    override val requirements: Set<Any> = setOf(subsystem)

    override fun run(p: TelemetryPacket): Boolean {
        // ... do something with the subsystem
        return true // or false
    }
}

//or

class MySubsystem {
    fun myAction(): Action {
        return Action { 
            // ... do something with the subsystem
            true // or false
        }.withRequirements(this)
    }
}
```

== Java

```java
class MyAction implements Action {
    private final Subsystem subsystem;
    private final HashSet<Object> reqs;
    //we define reqs as a field so it is not re-initialized every time

    public MyAction(Subsystem subsystem) {
        this.subsystem = subsystem;
        this.reqs = new HashSet<>(Collections.singletonList(subsystem))
    }

    @Override
    public Set<Object> getRequirements() {
        return reqs;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean run(@NonNull TelemetryPacket p) {
        // ... do something with the subsystem
        return true; // or false
    }
}

//or

class MySubsystem {
    public Action myAction() {
        return p -> { 
            // ... do something with the subsystem
            return true; // or false
        }.withRequirements(this);
    }
}

```

`ActionEx`, the expanded Action class, 
has two main methods of creating new Action types.

### Subclassing `ActionEx`

For more complex actions, you can use the `ActionEx` class. 
This class provides `init()`, `loop()`, and `end()` methods 
that are called at the beginning, during, and at the end of the action, respectively.

The `loop` method of an `ActionEx` follows the same logic as `Action`'s `run()`:
it should return `true` if the action is still running, 
and `false` if it has completed. 
Once it returns `false`, `end` is triggerred.

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin
class MyActionEx : ActionEx() {
    override fun init(packet: TelemetryPacket) {
        // ... called once at the beginning
    }

    override fun loop(packet: TelemetryPacket): Boolean {
        // ... called on every loop
        return true // or false
    }

    override fun end(packet: TelemetryPacket) {
        // ... called once at the end
    }
}
```

== Java

```java
class MyActionEx extends ActionEx {
    @Override
    public void init(@NonNull TelemetryPacket packet) {
        // ... called once at the beginning
    }

    @Override
    public boolean loop(@NonNull TelemetryPacket packet) {
        // ... called on every loop
        return true; // or false
    }

    @Override
    public void end(@NonNull TelemetryPacket packet) {
        // ... called once at the end
    }
}
```

### Building With `ActionEx`

`ActionEx` also provides a builder-style interface for creating actions. This is useful for creating complex actions without having to create a new class.

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin
val myAction = ActionEx()
    .withInit { /* ... called once at the beginning */ }
    .withLoop { /* ... called on every loop */ true }
    .withEnd { /* ... called once at the end */ }
    .withRequirements(/* optional */ )
```

== Java

```java
Action myAction = new ActionEx()
    .withInit(p -> { /* ... called once at the beginning */ })
    .withLoop(p -> { /* ... called on every loop */ return true; })
    .withEnd(p -> { /* ... called once at the end */ })
    .withRequirements(/* optional */ );
```

:::

An `InstantAction` is a simple action that executes a given function once and then completes.

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin
val myInstantAction = InstantAction { 
    // ... do something 
}
```

== Java

```java
InstantAction myInstantAction = new InstantAction(() -> {
    // ... do something
});
```

## Action Groups

`NextRunner` provides several ways to combine actions into groups.

- `SequentialAction`: Executes a series of actions one after the other.
- `ParallelAction`: Executes a group of actions at the same time. The group completes when all actions have completed.
- `RaceAction`: Executes a group of actions at the same time. The group completes when any one of the actions completes.
- `SleepAction` (not technically a group, but a similar utility): does nothing and completes after the specified `Duration`.

You can also use the `then()`, `with()`, `race()`, and `delay()`  functions to chain actions together in a more readable way.

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin
val myAction = MyAction1()
    .then(MyAction2()) // run MyAction2 after MyAction1
    .with(MyAction3())  // run MyAction3 at the same time
    .delay(1.0) //wait 1 second before executing
```

== Java

```java
Action myAction = new MyAction1()
    .then(new MyAction2()) // run MyAction2 after MyAction1
    .with(new MyAction3())  // run MyAction3 at the same time
    .delay(1.0) //wait 1 second before executing
```

:::

### `SleepAction`

The constructor for `SleepAction` actually accepts a `Duration` object,
which allows you to more easily specify durations:
:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin 
val delay500ms = SleepAction(500.milliseconds) //extension function from Kotlin stdlib
```

== Java

```java
Action delay500ms = SleepAction(Duration.ofMillis(500));
```
